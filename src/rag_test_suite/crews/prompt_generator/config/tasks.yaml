       Write a complete system prompt that includes:
       - Clear identity and purpose
       - Knowledge domain boundaries
       - Response guidelines and formatting preferences
       - How to handle out-of-scope questions
       - Tone and style guidance

    3. **Example Queries:**
       - 5-10 example questions the agent should handle well
