  description: >
    Based on the RAG knowledge summary, generate {num_tests} comprehensive test cases.

    **RAG Knowledge Summary:**
    {rag_summary}

    **Crew Description (what the crew is supposed to do):**
    {crew_description}

    **Test Distribution:**
    - Easy (30%): Direct factual questions with clear, unambiguous answers
    - Medium (50%): Questions requiring synthesis, context, or multi-step retrieval
    - Hard (20%): Edge cases, multi-hop reasoning, boundary conditions, ambiguous queries

    **Categories to Include:**
    {test_categories}

    **For Each Test Case, Provide:**
    - **id**: Unique identifier (TEST-001, TEST-002, etc.)
    - **question**: The exact query to send to the crew
    - **expected_answer**: The ideal response based on RAG content
    - **category**: One of: factual, reasoning, edge_case, out_of_scope, ambiguous
    - **difficulty**: easy, medium, or hard
    - **rationale**: Why this tests an important capability

    **Guidelines:**
    1. Base questions on actual content discovered in the RAG summary
    2. Include some out-of-scope questions to test boundary handling
    3. Vary question formats (what, how, why, compare, explain)
    4. Include both specific and general questions
    5. Make expected answers precise but not overly long

  expected_output: >
    A JSON array of exactly {num_tests} test cases:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "TEST-001",
        "question": "What is the definition of X?",
        "expected_answer": "X is defined as... based on the knowledge base content",
        "category": "factual",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "rationale": "Tests basic knowledge retrieval for core concept"
      },
      {
        "id": "TEST-002",
        "question": "How does X relate to Y?",
        "expected_answer": "X and Y are related because...",
        "category": "reasoning",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "rationale": "Tests ability to connect concepts across documents"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Ensure test cases cover all discovered domains and include variety
    in categories and difficulty levels.
